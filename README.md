A simple algorithm to flatten an arbitray array

## Setup

This solution is written in ruby, so you'll need a ruby install on your environment
and then use the following commands to install dependencies and run the tests.

### Using Docker

`docker build .; docker run <image_id>`


### Using Make (assuming you have ruby installed)

`make build; make test`


### Manually (assuming you have ruby installed)

Installing bundler:

`gem install bundler`

To install dependencies:

`bundle install`

To run all the tests:

`bundle exec rspec`
